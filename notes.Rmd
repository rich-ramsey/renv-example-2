```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This file tries to describe the process of using renv with git.


1. Describe basic usage here. tbc

2. A few settings need changing by adding the below to the .Rprofile file. Namely:

options(renv.settings.vcs.ignore.local = "FALSE") 

<!-- this stops ignoring local files and means that the renv.lock file will also be inder version control -->

renv::settings$snapshot.type("all") 

<!-- this means that all packages are recorded in snapshot, rather than the default, which is clever and uses renv::dependencies, but may also miss things. Hence, opt for the conservative approach. -->

Now when the project starts these settings are implemented.
